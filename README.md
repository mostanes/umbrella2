# Umbrella2

Umbrella2 is a highly modular, open-source library for asteroid detection written under dotnet.

Functions are provided for:
* Badpixel removal
* Noise removal
* Object detection, including very faint trails
* Object pairing
* Object and tracklet display
* MPC report generation
* SkyBoT and VizieR querying

In addition, user image processing functions can take advantage of the algorithms framework and use the multi-threaded CPU scheduler for easy algorithm parallelization.
